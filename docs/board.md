# Board

The `\Pchess\Chess\Board` class is an array-like class, in which every element is a square of [`\Pchess\Chess\Chess`](chess.md).

The typical use of this class is calling `$board[$square]`, or cycling it:

```php
$board = new \PChess\Chess\Board();

// use it directly...
$piece = $board[$square];

// ... or cycle it
foreach ($board as $offset => $piece) {
    // $offset is an integer, $piece can be a Piece or null
}
```

The only method that can be directly used is `$board->reverse()`, useful to toggle sides (e.g. to see
the board from black point of view, and then from white again).

The following static methods can be used if you need to deal
with [SAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)):

* `rank()`: get the rank of a square, as number between 1 and 8
* `file()`: get the file of a square, as number between 1 and 8
* `algebraic()`: get the SAN of a square, as string (e.g. "e2").
   This should be the same as calling `Board::SQUARES[$square]`

Such methods accept a integer square (see `SQUARES` constant). 

Useful constants represent starting board (`Board::DEFAULT_POSITION`) and empty board (`Board::EMPTY`)
in [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) notation.

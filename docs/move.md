|`$turn`       | string  | 'w' or 'b'               |
|`$flags`      | int     | move type bits           |
|`$piece`      | Piece   | [Piece object](piece.md) |
|`$from`       | string  | from square              |
|`$to`         | string  | to square                |
|`$fromSquare` | int     | from square              |
|`$toSquare`   | int     | to square                |

|`$promotion`  | ?string | promotion                |

Squares are coded like in keys and/or values of `\Pchess\Chess\Board::SQUARES`
Notation is [SAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess))

Move can be built directly with is contructor, passing all arguments in respective order.
Or it can be built using static method `Move::buildMove()`:

```php
public static function buildMove(
    string $turn,
    Board $board,
    int $from,
    int $to,
    int $flags,
    ?string $promotion = null
);
```

The `$san` property is set in the `move()` method of [`\Pchess\Chess\Chess`](chess.md) class.

The informations about move type, stored in `$flags` properties as bits, are:
